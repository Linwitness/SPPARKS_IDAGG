#Navigate in terminal to directory you wish to use for SPPARKS project

#clone SPPARKS-AGG and create master branch

git clone https://github.com/FHilty/SPPARKS-AGG.git
cd SPPARKS-AGG
git checkout master

#Navigate to the make files

cd src/MAKE

#Modify make file to point to JPEG libraries to enable saving microstructures to jpeg images
#Open Makefile.agg in your favorite text editor change lines 45-47 to point to your jpeg libraries
#Lines should look similar to the following:

JPG_INC =  -I /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/9c/include/      
JPG_PATH = -I /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/9c/lib/ 
JPG_LIB =     /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/9c/lib/libjpeg.a

#From src directory (Up one from MAKE) run make command

make agg

#When completed copy the spparks executable "spk_agg" up one directory

cp spk_agg ../

#You are now ready to use SPPARKS for abnormal grain growth


#To run an example navigate to the hexagonal structure example for abnormal grain growth

cd examples/agg/Hex

#There should be 3 files in this folder with extensions .init, .in, and .sh
#The initial conditions (Grain IDs and Euler Angles) are contained in .init
#The input script is .in
#The script to run the input script is .sh

#To run the executable script you first need to make the .sh file an executable, then run it

chmod +x agg_hex.sh
./agg_hex.sh

#If SPPARKS is compiled correctly it will dump an image for each MC step into the Images folder

#For more infomration consult the SPPARKS manual (Manual.pdf) in the doc folder
